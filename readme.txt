== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= How does this plugin provides security and access to all employees and managers ?=
 
You can either use wordpress default role or can create kickstart role.
Kickstart roles are the most secured roles if you want your employees can see only this plugin,and can only submit given task.
Or else if you want your employee can also edit your site,then select "Editor" role while creating employees.
Althogh, kickstart provided "Administrator" role,Never create user with this role without its actual need.
